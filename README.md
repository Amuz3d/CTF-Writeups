CTF-Writeups
Welcome to my collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups. This repository serves as a dual-purpose project: a personal archive of my growth in cybersecurity and a structured learning resource for others.

📁 Repository Goal
I am currently documenting my journey through platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe. These writeups are "washed" and refined through an LLM to ensure they are clear, readable, and educational—specifically tailored for a friend I am mentoring in the basics of penetration testing.

🛠️ My Methodology
I follow the "Try Harder" philosophy. When I hit a wall, I commit to at least 1–2 hours of independent research, manual enumeration, and trial-and-error before consulting external walkthroughs. This ensures that I understand the why behind a vulnerability, not just the how.

📝 Writeup Format
Every walkthrough in this repository is standardized for clarity:

Reconnaissance: Initial scans and service enumeration.

Foothold: Exploitation and initial access.

Movement: Lateral movement and privilege escalation.

Key Takeaways: What was learned from the machine.

Note: These writeups are intended for educational purposes only. Always practice ethical hacking on authorized platforms.
